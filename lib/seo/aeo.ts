        answer: "Our top-rated strains include a carefully curated selection of Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid varieties.

        question: "What is the difference between Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid cannabis?",
        answer: "Indica strains typically produce relaxing, body-focused effects ideal for evening use, pain relief, and sleep. Sativa strains tend to create energizing, cerebral effects suited for daytime creativity and focus. Hybrid strains combine characteristics of both, with ratios varying by cultivar. Modern cannabis science shows that terpene profiles (aromatic compounds like myrcene, limonene, and pinene) are often more predictive of effects than the Indica/Sativa classification alone. At Mohawk Medibles, every strain includes a full terpene breakdown to help you find your ideal match.",

    {
        question: "What are terpenes and why do they matter in cannabis?",
        answer: "Terpenes are aromatic compounds found in all plants, including cannabis. They produce the distinct smells and flavors of each strain — from the citrusy zing of limonene to the earthy calm of myrcene. More importantly, terpenes contribute to the 'entourage effect,' working synergistically with THC and CBD to modulate your experience. For example, myrcene enhances relaxation, limonene boosts mood, and caryophyllene has anti-inflammatory properties. At Mohawk Medibles, we lab-test every flower batch for its complete terpene profile so you can make informed choices.",

    // ── Dosing ──────────────────────────────────────────────
    {
        question: "How do I choose the right cannabis edible dosage?",
        answer: "For edible cannabis, we recommend the 'start low, go slow' approach: Beginners should start with 2.5-5mg THC, wait 2 full hours before considering more. Regular consumers may find 10-25mg effective. Experienced users may use 25-50mg+ based on tolerance. Edibles take 30-120 minutes to take effect and last 4-8 hours, significantly longer than smoking or vaping. Always check the mg per serving on the package. Our product pages list exact THC content per piece for precise dosing.",

    {
        question: "What is microdosing cannabis and how does it work?",
        answer: "Microdosing cannabis involves taking very small amounts (1-5mg THC) to achieve subtle therapeutic benefits without the full psychoactive 'high.' Benefits may include reduced anxiety, enhanced focus, mild pain relief, and improved sleep quality. The technique is popular among professionals and wellness-conscious consumers. To microdose effectively: start with 2.5mg THC, maintain consistent timing (morning or evening), keep a journal of effects, and adjust by 1mg increments. Our low-dose edibles (5mg per piece) are designed specifically for microdosing.",
