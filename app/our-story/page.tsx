                        <p>
                            Mohawk Medibles was born from a simple conviction: our community deserves access to
                            safe, lab-tested, premium cannabis &mdash; and the economic sovereignty that comes
                            with building our own.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Founded in 2019 on Six Nations of the Grand River Territory, we started as a
                            small operation with a big vision. Cannabis has deep roots in Indigenous traditions
                            of healing and ceremony. We saw an opportunity to honour that relationship while
                            building something that would benefit our families and our community for
                            generations to come.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What began as a local dispensary serving our neighbours has grown into a trusted
                            name across Canada, with over 25,000 customers and 360+ products in our catalogue.
                            But no matter how far we reach, our roots remain firmly planted in Six Nations soil.

                            Six Nations of the Grand River is the largest First Nations reserve in Canada,
                            home to all six nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy: the Mohawk, Cayuga,
                            Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca, and Tuscarora. Our ancestors walked this land for
                            thousands of years, guided by the Great Law of Peace &mdash; one of the oldest
                            participatory democracies on Earth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Mohawk people, we carry forward values of community strength, respect for the
                            natural world, and the responsibility to provide for the next seven generations.
                            These aren&apos;t slogans on a website &mdash; they&apos;re the principles that shape
                            every decision we make, from which products we stock to how we treat every
                            customer who walks through our doors or places an order online.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Indigenous sovereignty includes economic sovereignty. Every purchase from Mohawk
                            Medibles directly supports Indigenous families and community initiatives on Six
                            Nations territory. You&apos;re not just buying cannabis &mdash; you&apos;re investing in
                            a community&apos;s future.

                            Revenue from Mohawk Medibles stays in the community. We employ locally, source
                            from Indigenous producers when possible, and contribute to community programs on
                            Six Nations. When we grow, our community grows.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also believe in education. Cannabis prohibition disproportionately impacted
                            Indigenous communities across Canada. Part of our mission is to destigmatize
                            cannabis use, provide accurate information about products and dosing, and ensure
                            our customers make informed decisions. That&apos;s why every product page includes
                            detailed usage guides, FAQ sections, and honest descriptions.
