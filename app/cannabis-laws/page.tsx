// ─── Hub FAQ Data ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

const HUB_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Is cannabis legal in all of Canada?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Cannabis was legalized across Canada on October 17, 2018, under the Cannabis Act (Bill C-45). However, each province and territory has the authority to set its own regulations regarding legal age, retail models, possession limits in private spaces, consumption locations, and home cultivation rules. The federal law sets the baseline, but provincial regulations may be stricter.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the legal age to buy cannabis in Canada?",
    answer:
      "The legal age varies by province. Most provinces set the legal age at 19, matching their drinking age. Alberta sets it at 18, and Quebec raised it to 21 in 2020. The federal minimum is 18, but provinces can set it higher. You must carry valid government-issued photo ID when purchasing.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much cannabis can you legally possess in Canada?",
    answer:
      "Under federal law, adults can possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis (or equivalent) in public. At home, you can store as much legally purchased or home-grown cannabis as you wish, unless your province has set additional limits. The 30g limit applies to what you carry on your person in public spaces.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you grow cannabis at home in Canada?",
    answer:
      "Most provinces allow adults to grow up to 4 cannabis plants per household for personal use, as permitted under federal law. However, Quebec and Manitoba have banned home cultivation entirely. In provinces where it is allowed, plants must be grown from legally obtained seeds or seedlings, and landlords or condo boards may impose additional restrictions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can you legally consume cannabis in Canada?",
    answer:
      "Consumption rules vary significantly by province. Generally, cannabis can be consumed in private residences. Some provinces allow consumption wherever tobacco smoking is permitted, while others are more restrictive. Cannabis consumption is universally prohibited in vehicles, workplaces, and near schools or playgrounds. Some provinces, like Ontario, allow public consumption in most areas where tobacco is allowed, while Quebec restricts it to private residences only.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can you drive after consuming cannabis in Canada?",
    answer:
      "Driving under the influence of cannabis is illegal everywhere in Canada. Federal law sets two criminal offences based on THC blood levels: 2-5 ng/mL THC results in a summary conviction with a maximum $1,000 fine, while 5+ ng/mL THC or combined THC + alcohol can lead to mandatory minimum penalties, licence suspension, and imprisonment. Many provinces also have zero-tolerance policies for novice and young drivers. Roadside saliva testing (Draeger DrugTest 5000) is authorized for screening.",
