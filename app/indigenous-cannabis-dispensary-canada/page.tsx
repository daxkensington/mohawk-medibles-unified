        question: "What is an Indigenous cannabis dispensary?",
        answer:
            "An Indigenous cannabis dispensary is a cannabis retail business owned and operated by Indigenous peoples, typically located on or connected to First Nations, Métis, or Inuit territories. These dispensaries operate under the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous nations and their right to self-governance and economic self-determination. Mohawk Medibles is an Indigenous-owned cannabis dispensary operating from Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, serving customers across all 13 Canadian provinces and territories with 360+ premium, lab-tested cannabis products.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is it legal to buy from an Indigenous dispensary in Canada?",
        answer:
            "Indigenous cannabis dispensaries like Mohawk Medibles operate under the inherent sovereignty and self-governance rights of Indigenous nations, which predate Canadian confederation. The Mohawk Nation and the broader Haudenosaunee Confederacy have a long history of trade and commerce that is protected under Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Mohawk Medibles has been serving Canadian customers reliably since 2019, shipping discreetly via Canada Post Xpresspost to all provinces and territories. All products meet our rigorous Empire Standard\u2122 quality program, including third-party lab testing.",
    },
    {
        question: "How does Mohawk Medibles ship across Canada?",
        answer:
            "Mohawk Medibles ships to all 13 Canadian provinces and territories via Canada Post Xpresspost. Orders are processed same-day when placed before our daily cutoff, and typical delivery takes 2\u20135 business days depending on your location. All packages are shipped in discreet, smell-proof packaging with no identifying markings. Shipping is free on orders over $199, and a flat rate of $15 applies to orders under that threshold. Every shipment includes tracking so you can follow your package from our facility in Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory to your door.",
    },
    {
        question: "What products does Mohawk Medibles carry?",
        answer:
            "Mohawk Medibles carries over 360 premium cannabis products across seven main categories: Flower (including AAAA, AAA+, and craft strains), Edibles (gummies, chocolates, baked goods, and beverages), Concentrates (shatter, live resin, diamonds, and distillate), Vapes (cartridges and disposable pens), Hash (traditional and premium pressed), Pre-Rolls (singles, multi-packs, and infused), and CBD products (oils, tinctures, capsules, and topicals). Every product meets our Empire Standard\u2122 quality requirements, including third-party lab testing for potency, terpene profiling, and contaminant screening.",
    },
    {
        question: "How does buying from Indigenous dispensaries support communities?",
        answer:
            "When you purchase from an Indigenous cannabis dispensary like Mohawk Medibles, your dollars directly support Indigenous economic sovereignty and community development. A significant portion of our revenue is reinvested into Mohawk Territory community programs, youth initiatives, cultural preservation projects, and local employment. Unlike purchasing from large corporate cannabis retailers, buying from Indigenous-owned businesses helps close the economic gap, creates jobs within Indigenous communities, and supports the broader movement toward Indigenous self-determination and economic independence. Every order from Mohawk Medibles is an investment in Indigenous futures.",
    },
    {
        question: "What makes Mohawk Medibles different from other online dispensaries?",
        answer:
            "Mohawk Medibles stands apart in several key ways: First, we are authentically Indigenous-owned and operated from Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory — not a corporate brand using Indigenous imagery. Second, our Empire Standard\u2122 quality program ensures every product is lab-tested, terpene-profiled, and contaminant-screened before it reaches our shelves. Third, we offer tax-free pricing, making our products more affordable than government dispensaries. Fourth, we have been operating since 2019 with over 47,000 satisfied customers across Canada. Fifth, a portion of every purchase supports Mohawk Territory community programs. And sixth, we offer free shipping on orders over $199 with discreet, same-day processing.",
    },
    {
        question: "Does Mohawk Medibles offer same-day delivery?",
        answer:
            "Mohawk Medibles offers same-day order processing for all orders placed before our daily cutoff time. While we do not offer same-day delivery to your door (as we ship Canada-wide via Canada Post Xpresspost), orders are packed and shipped the same day they are placed. Typical delivery times are 2\u20133 business days for Ontario and Quebec, 3\u20134 days for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, and 4\u20135 days for Atlantic provinces, the Territories, and remote areas. All shipments include full tracking.",
    },
    {
        question: "What payment methods does Mohawk Medibles accept?",
        answer:
            "Mohawk Medibles accepts three convenient payment methods: Credit Card (Visa, Mastercard, and American Express) processed securely through our payment gateway, Interac e-Transfer (Canada\u2019s most trusted direct bank payment method), and Cryptocurrency for customers who prefer decentralized payment. All transactions are processed securely, and your financial information is never stored on our servers.",

                            The relationship between Indigenous peoples and cannabis in Canada is deeply intertwined with
                            broader questions of <strong className="text-foreground">sovereignty, self-determination, and economic independence</strong>.
                            Long before European contact, Indigenous nations across Turtle Island cultivated, traded, and
                            used medicinal plants as part of their healing traditions. Today, Indigenous cannabis dispensaries
                            represent a modern expression of these ancient rights.

                        <p>
                            The Haudenosaunee Confederacy — of which the Mohawk Nation is a founding member — established
                            one of the world&apos;s first constitutional democracies through the Great Law of Peace
                            (Kaianere&apos;kó:wa). This governance structure, which predates the Canadian Constitution by
                            centuries, includes provisions for trade, commerce, and economic sovereignty that remain in
                            effect today. The Mohawk people have always been known as traders and entrepreneurs — the
                            &quot;Keepers of the Eastern Door&quot; of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mohawk Medibles operates within this rich tradition. Our dispensary is not merely a retail
                            business — it is an expression of Mohawk economic sovereignty and the continuation of
                            centuries-old trade practices. We source products from Indigenous and Canadian growers who
                            share our commitment to quality and community, and we apply rigorous testing standards
                            that honour both modern science and traditional knowledge.

                        <p>
                            Section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> recognizes and affirms existing Aboriginal and
                            treaty rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada. These rights include the inherent right to
                            self-governance and economic self-determination. Indigenous-operated cannabis businesses like
                            Mohawk Medibles exercise these rights while maintaining rigorous quality and safety standards
                            that often exceed those of government-regulated dispensaries.

                        <p>
                            The history of cannabis prohibition in Canada disproportionately affected Indigenous communities.
                            As the country has moved toward legalization, Indigenous nations have asserted their right to
                            participate in the cannabis economy on their own terms — not as licensees of the federal or
                            provincial governments, but as sovereign nations exercising their inherent jurisdiction over
                            commerce within their territories.

                        <p>
                            For many Indigenous communities, cannabis has become an important vehicle for economic
                            development and self-sufficiency. Revenue generated by Indigenous cannabis dispensaries
                            stays within the community — funding education, healthcare, cultural preservation, youth
                            programs, and infrastructure. When Canadians choose to purchase from an Indigenous-owned
                            dispensary like Mohawk Medibles, they are making a direct investment in Indigenous economic
                            sovereignty and community wellbeing.
